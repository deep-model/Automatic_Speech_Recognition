# AI-Driven Speech Recognition Models & End-to-End ASR 
# Using Nvidia NeMo toolkit ASR

This repository hosts a **GitHub Pages–optimized version** of the ASR Report by **Matthew Harper**.

**Abstract**: AI-based  speech recognition is a rapidly growing field of research which 
has transformed the way humans interact not only with machines but with each other. 
Speech recognition is considered a technology that enables machines to understand 
and interpret human speech [1]. Also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), 
computer speech recognition or speech-to-text, is a capability that enables a 
program to process human speech into a written format. While speech recognition is
commonly confused with voice recognition, speech recognition focuses on the 
translation of speech from a verbal format to a text one whereas voice recognition 
just seeks to identify an individual user’s voice [6]. This report provides a 
summary introduction into speech recognition models and illustrates a basic ASR 
model with the lab practicum.
